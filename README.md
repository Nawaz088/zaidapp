this repo contains website of my client since he is not technical i am using excel sheet for updating the content(e.g aboutMe section and other writing parts) that other wise requires changing from source code. I this project i am using python as a backend mainly flask for creating endpoint and pandas for reading Excel file and converting to json

BTW when I am calling the endpoint API I am getting the data in the form of string so I have to use JSON.parse() function
